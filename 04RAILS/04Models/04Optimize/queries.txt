Retrieve all players, then write a program that will loop through each player and display their team name, mascot and stadium. How many queries have we done?

	players = Player.includes(:team)
	players.each do |player|
		puts player.team.name, player.team.mascot, player.team.stadium
	end

Retrieve all players from the 'Chicago Bulls' by using .includes

	players = Player.joins(:team).where("teams.name = 'Chicago Bulls'")
	players.each do |player|
		puts player.name
	end

Retrieve all players along with the team name that play at the 'Staples Center'


	players = Player.joins(:team).where("teams.stadium = 'Staples Center'")
	players.each do |player|
		puts player.name, player.team.name
	end
