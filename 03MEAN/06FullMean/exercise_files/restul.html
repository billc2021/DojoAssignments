        <h1>RESTful Architecture</h1>
        <h2>Consistent naming keeps big projects organized.</h2>
        <p>
            Large projects can easily become a morass of confusing function names, especially in projects in stacks like the MEAN stack where data are passed as objects throughout the project. Using standardized design principles throughout a project can help prevent confusing code. A common starting point for standardization for projects is RESTful routing as described here. This is just a starting point for many projects. For enterprise level projects, a good style guide will extend all the way through how variables should be named and placed in the code, and more!
